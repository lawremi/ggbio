I built this simple site for a friend of mine, who runs a telecommunications consulting company. I created the logo and designed the site mostly [in the browser](http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup "24 ways: Make Your Mockup in Markup") as part of a custom WordPress template. The site doesn't have a blog—it just runs WordPress as the CMS engine since the client was more familiar with it (as opposed to Drupal or Joomla)
