\section{Introduction}
\ggbio{} is a \Bioc{} package building on top of \ggplot(), leveraging
the rich objects defined by \Bioc{} and its statistical and
computational power, it provides a flexible genomic visualization
framework, extends the grammar of graphics into genomic data, try to
delivers high quality, highly customizable graphics to the users.

What it features
\begin{itemize}
\item \autoplot{} function provides ready-to-use template for \Bioc{}
  objects and different types of data.
\item flexible low level components to use grammar of graphics to
  build you graphics layer by layer.
\item layout transformation, so you could generate circular plot,
  grandlinear plot, stacked overview more easily.
\item flexible tracks function to bind any \ggplot(), \ggbio{} based
  plots.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Case study: building your first tracks}
In this chapter, you will learn
\begin{itemize}
\item how to add ideogram track.
\item How to add gene model track.
\item how to add track for bam files to visualize coverage and mismatch summary.
\item how to add track for vcf file to visualize the variants.
\end{itemize}


\section{Add an ideogram track}\label{section:ideo}
\Rfunction{Ideogram} provides functionality to construct ideogram,
check the manual for more flexible methods. We build genome
\textit{hg19, hg18, mm10, mm9} inside, so you don't have download it
on the fly. When embed with tracks, ideogram show zoomed region
highlights automatically. \Rfunction{xlim} has special function here,
is too changed highlighted zoomed region on the ideogram.

\section{Add a gene model track}\label{section:gene}
\subsection{Introduction}

Gene model track is one of the most frequently used track in genome
browser, it is composed of genetic features CDS, UTR, introns, exons
and non-genetic region. In \ggbio{} we support three methods to make
gene model track:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \Rclass{OrganismDb} object: recommended, support gene symbols and other
    combination of columns as label.
  \item \Rclass{TxDb} object: don't support gene symbol labeling.
  \item \Rclass{GRangesList} object: flexible, if you don't have
    annotation package available for the first two methods, you could
    prepare a data set parsed from gtf file, you can simply use it and
    plot it as gene model track.
  \item \Rclass{EnsDb} object: supports gene symbol labeling, filtering etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Make gene model from \Rclass{OrganismDb} object}
\Rclass{OrganismDb} object has a simpler API to retrieve data from
different annotation resources, so we could label our transcripts in
different ways


<<>>=
library(ggbio)
library(Homo.sapiens)
class(Homo.sapiens)
##
data(genesymbol, package = "biovizBase")
wh <- genesymbol[c("BRCA1", "NBR1")]
wh <- range(wh, ignore.strand = TRUE)


p.txdb <- autoplot(Homo.sapiens, which  = wh)
p.txdb

autoplot(Homo.sapiens, which  = wh, label.color = "black", color = "brown",
          fill = "brown")
@

To change the intron geometry, use \Rcode{gap.geom} to control it,
check out \Rfunction{geom\_alignment} for more control parameters.

<<>>=
autoplot(Homo.sapiens, which  = wh, gap.geom = "chevron")
@

To collapse all features, use \Rcode{stat} 'reduce'

<<fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 1.5>>=
autoplot(Homo.sapiens, which = wh, stat = "reduce")
@

Label could be turned off by setting it to \Rcode{FALSE}, you could
also use expression to make a flexible label combination from column names.

<<>>=
columns(Homo.sapiens)
autoplot(Homo.sapiens, which  = wh, columns = c("TXNAME", "GO"), names.expr = "TXNAME::GO")
@


\subsection{Make gene model from \Rclass{TxDb} object}
\Rclass{TxDb} doesn't contain any gene symbol information, so
we use tx\_id as default for label.
<<>>=
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
autoplot(txdb, which = wh)
@

\subsection{Make gene model from \Rclass{EnsDb} object}

An alternative source for gene models are the \Rclass{EnsDb} objects from the
\Biocpkg{ensembldb} package that provide gene annotations provided from
Ensembl. The \Biocpkg{ensembldb} package provides a rich filtering system that
allows to easily fetch specific information (genes/transcripts) from an
\Rclass{EnsDb}. The \Rclass{EnsDb} objects provide gene symbol annotations in
the column gene\_name. Alternatively, we could use tx\_id to label transcripts.

In the example below we plot the gene model of the gene PHKG2. We use a
\Rclass{GenenameFilter} to specify which gene we want to plot.

<<>>=
library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75)
ensdb <- EnsDb.Hsapiens.v75
autoplot(ensdb, GeneNameFilter("PHKG2"))
@

We can pass any filter class defined in the \Biocpkg{AnnotationFilter} package
with argument \Rclass{which}. Alternatively we can combine filter classes using
an \Rclass{AnnotationFilterList} or we can pass a filter expression in form of a
\Rclass{formula}. Below we pass such a filter expression to the function.

<<>>=
autoplot(ensdb, ~ symbol == "PHKG2", names.expr="gene_name")
@

We could also specify a genomic region and fetch all transcripts overlapping
that region (also partially, i.e. with a part of an intron or an exon).

<<>>=
## We specify "*" as strand, thus we query for genes encoded  on both strands
gr <- GRanges(seqnames = 16, IRanges(30768000, 30770000), strand = "*")
autoplot(ensdb, GRangesFilter(gr), names.expr = "gene_name")
@

Also, we can spefify directly the gene ids and plot all transcripts of these
genes (not only those overlapping with the region)

<<>>=
autoplot(ensdb, GeneIdFilter(c("ENSG00000196118", "ENSG00000156873")))
@

\subsection{Make gene model from \Rclass{GRangesList} object}
Sometimes your gene model is not available as none of
\Rclass{OrganismDb} or \Rclass{TxDb} object, it's may be stored
in a table, you could simple parse it into a \Rclass{GRangeList}
object.
\begin{itemize}
  \item each group indicate one transcripts
  \item names of group are shown as labels
  \item this object must has a column contains following key word:
    cds, exon, intron, and it's not case senstitive. use \Rcode{type}
    to map this column. By default, we will try to parse 'type' column.
\end{itemize}

Let's make a sample \Rclass{GRangesList} object which contains all
information, and fake some labels.
<<>>=
library(biovizBase)
gr.txdb <- crunch(txdb, which = wh)
## change column to 'model'
colnames(values(gr.txdb))[4] <- "model"
grl <- split(gr.txdb, gr.txdb$tx_id)
## fake some randome names
names(grl) <- sample(LETTERS, size = length(grl), replace = TRUE)
grl
@

We get our example data ready, it meets all requirements, to make it a
gene model track it's pretty simple to use autoplot, but don't forget
mapping because we changed our column names, asssume you store you
model key words in column 'model'.

<<>>=
autoplot(grl, aes(type = model))
ggplot() + geom_alignment(grl, type = "model")
@


\section{Add a reference track}\label{section:reference}
To add a reference track, we need to load a \Rclass{BSgenome} object
from the annotation package. You can choose to plot the sequence as
\textit{text, rect, segment}.

\subsection{Semantic zoom}
Here we introduce semantic zoom in \ggbio{}, for some plots like
reference sequence, we use pre-defined zoom level threshold to
automatically assign geom to the track, unless the geom is explicitly
specified. In the example below, when your region is too wide we show
text 'zoom in to see text', when you zoom into different level, it
shows you different details. \Rfunction{zoom} is a function we will
introduce more in chapter \ref{chapter:nav} when we introduce more
about navigation.

You can pass a zoom in factor into \Rfunction{zoom} function, if it's
over 1 it's zooming out, if it's smaller than 1 it's zooming in.

<<fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 1.5>>=
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
bg <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19
p.bg <- autoplot(bg, which = wh)
## no geom
p.bg
## segment
p.bg + zoom(1/100)
## rectangle
p.bg + zoom(1/1000)
## text
p.bg + zoom(1/2500)
@



To override a zemantic zoom threshold, you simply provide a geom explicitly.
<<eval = FALSE>>=
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
bg <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19
## force to use geom 'segment' at this level
autoplot(bg, which = resize(wh, width = width(wh)/2000), geom = "segment")
@


\section{Add an alignment track}\label{section:bam}
\ggbio{} supports visuaization of alignemnts file stored in bam,
\autoplot{} method accepts
\begin{itemize}
\item bam file path (indexed)
\item \Rclass{BamFile} object
\item \Rclass{GappedAlignemnt} object
\end{itemize}

It's simple to just pass a file path to \autoplot{} function, you can
stream a chunk of region by providing 'which' parameter. Otherwise
please use method 'estiamte' to show overall estiamted coverage.



<<>>=
fl.bam <- system.file("extdata", "wg-brca1.sorted.bam", package  = "biovizBase")
library(GenomeInfoDb)  # for keepSeqlevels()
wh <- keepSeqlevels(wh, "chr17")
autoplot(fl.bam, which = wh)
@


geom 'gapped pair' will show you alignments.

<<>>=
fl.bam <- system.file("extdata", "wg-brca1.sorted.bam", package  = "biovizBase")
wh <- keepSeqlevels(wh, "chr17")
autoplot(fl.bam, which = resize(wh, width = width(wh)/10), geom = "gapped.pair")
@


To show mismatch proportion, you have to provide reference sequence,
the mismatched proportion is color coded in the bar chart.
<<>>=
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
bg <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19
p.mis <- autoplot(fl.bam, bsgenome = bg, which = wh, stat = "mismatch")
p.mis
@

To view overall estimated coverage distribution, please use method
'estiamte'. 'which' parameter also accept characters. And there is a
hidden value called '..coverage..' to let you do simple transformation
in aes().
<<>>=
autoplot(fl.bam, method = "estimate")
autoplot(fl.bam, method = "estimate", which = paste0("chr", 17:18), aes(y = log(..coverage..)))
@

\section{Add a variants track}\label{section:vcf}
This track is supported by semantic zoom.

To view your variants file, you could
\begin{itemize}
\item Import it using package \Biocpkg{VariantAnntoation} as
  \Rclass{VCF} object, then use \autoplot{}
\item Convert it into \Rclass{VRanges} object and use \autoplot{}.
\item Simply provide vcf file path in \autoplot().
\end{itemize}

<<>>=
library(VariantAnnotation)
fl.vcf <- system.file("extdata", "17-1409-CEU-brca1.vcf.bgz", package="biovizBase")
vcf <- readVcf(fl.vcf, "hg19")
vr <- as(vcf[, 1:3], "VRanges")
vr <- renameSeqlevels(vr, value = c("17" = "chr17"))
## small region contains data
gr17 <- GRanges("chr17", IRanges(41234400, 41234530))
p.vr <- autoplot(vr, which = wh)
## none geom
p.vr
## rect geom
p.vr + xlim(gr17)
## text geom
p.vr + xlim(gr17) + zoom()
@


You can simply overide geom
<<eval = FALSE>>=
autoplot(vr, which = wh, geom = "rect", arrow = FALSE)
@

%% If 'summary' is turned on, it will show you a summary of genotype
%% barchar for all samples on top and detailed one for specified samples
%% below it.

%% We have 116 samples in this VCF data,
%% <<>>=
%% str(vcf)
%% autoplot(vcf, which = wh, sample = 1:3, summary = TRUE)
%% nms <- c("NA06984" "NA06985" "NA06986")
%% autoplot(vcf, which = wh, sample = 1:3, summary = TRUE)
%% @


\section{Building your tracks}
<<fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5.5>>=
## tks <- tracks(p.ideo, mismatch = p.mis, dbSNP = p.vr, ref = p.bs, gene = p.txdb)
## tks <- tracks(fl.bam, fl.vcf, bs, Homo.sapiens) ## default ideo = FALSE, turned on
## tks <- tracks(fl.bam, fl.vcf, bs, Homo.sapiens, ideo = TRUE)
## tks + xlim(gr17)
gr17 <- GRanges("chr17", IRanges(41234415, 41234569))
tks <- tracks(p.ideo, mismatch = p.mis, dbSNP = p.vr, ref = p.bg, gene = p.txdb,
              heights = c(2, 3, 3, 1, 4)) + xlim(gr17) + theme_tracks_sunset()
tks
@



\chapter{Simple navigation}\label{chapter:nav}
We try to provide a simple navigation API for your plot, so you could
zoom in and zoom out, or go through view chunks one by one.

\begin{itemize}
\item \Rfunction{zoom}: put a factor inside and you can zoom in or zoom out
\item \Rfunction{nextView}: switch to next view
\item \Rfunction{prevView}: switch to previous view
\end{itemize}

Navigation function also works for tracks plot too.

<<fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5.5>>=
## zoom in
tks + zoom()
@

Try following command yourself.
<<eval = FALSE>>=
## zoom in with scale
p.txdb + zoom(1/8)
## zoom out
p.txdb + zoom(2)
## next view page
p.txdb + nextView()
## previous view page
p.txdb + prevView()
@

Don't forget \Rfunction{xlim} accept \Rclass{GRanges} object (single
row), so you could simply prepare a \Rclass{GRanges} to store the
region of interests and go through them one by one.



\chapter{Overview plots}\label{chapter:overview}
Overview is a good way to show all events at the same time, give overall summary statiics for the whole genome.

In this chapter, we will introcue three different layouts that are used a lots in genomic data visualization.
\section{how to make circular plots}\label{section:circular}
\subsection{Introduction}
Circular view is a special layout in \ggbio{} , this idea has been implemented
in many different software, for example, the \software{Circos} project. However, we keep the grammar of graphics for users, so mapping varialbes to aesthetics is very easy, \ggbio{} leverage the data structure defiend in \Bioc{} to make this process as simple as possible.



\subsection{Buidling circular plot layer by layer}

Ok, let's start to process some raw data to the format we want. The
data used in this study is from this a
paper\footnote{http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v43/n10/full/ng.936.html}. In
this tutorial, We are going to
\begin{enumerate}
\item Visualize somatic mutation as segment.
\item Visualize inter,intro-chromosome rearrangement as links.
\item Visualize mutation score as point tracks with grid-background.
\item Add scale and ticks and labels.
\item To arrange multiple plots and legend. create multiple sample comparison.
\end{enumerate}


All the raw data processed and stored in \Rclass{GRanges} ready for use, you can simply load the sample data from \biovizBase{}


<<processing>>=
data("CRC", package  = "biovizBase")
@



\Rfunction{layout\_circle} is depreicated, because you have to set up radius and trackWidth manually with this function for creating circular plot.

We now present the new \Rfunction{circle} function, it
accepts \Robject{Granges} object, and users don't have to specify radius, track width,
you just add them one by one, it will be automatically created from innter circle to outside, unless you specify \Rcode{trackWidth} and \Rcode{radius} manually. To change default radius and trackWidth for all tracks, you simply put them in \Rfunction{ggbio} function.

\begin{itemize}
\item rule of thumb \Rfunction{seqlengths}, \Rfunction{seqlevels} and chromosomes
  names should be exactly the same.
\item to use \Rfunction{circle}, you have to use \Rfunction{ggbio} constructor at the beginning instead of \Rfunction{ggplot}.
\end{itemize}

You can use \autoplot{} to create single track easily like
<<>>=
head(hg19sub)
autoplot(hg19sub, layout = "circle", fill  = "gray70")
@


Hoever, the low level \Rfunction{circle} function leave you more
flexibility to build circular plot one by one. Let's start to add
tracks one by one.



Let's use the same data to create ideogram, label and scale track, it layouts the circle by the order you created from inside to outside.
<<>>=
p <- ggbio() + circle(hg19sub, geom = "ideo", fill = "gray70") +
    circle(hg19sub, geom = "scale", size = 2) +
  circle(hg19sub, geom = "text", aes(label = seqnames), vjust = 0, size = 3)
p
@

To simply override the setting, you can do it globally in \Rfunction{ggbio} function or individually \Rfunction{circle} function by specifying parametters \Rcode{trackWidth} and \Rcode{radius}, you can also specify the global settin for buffer in between in \Rfunction{ggbio} like example below.

<<>>=
p <- ggbio(trackWidth = 10, buffer = 0, radius = 10) + circle(hg19sub, geom = "ideo", fill = "gray70") +
    circle(hg19sub, geom = "scale", size = 2) +
  circle(hg19sub, geom = "text", aes(label = seqnames), vjust = 0, size = 3)
p
@


Then we add a "rectangle" track to show somatic mutation, this will looks like vertical
segments.
<<lower-mut-track>>=
head(mut.gr)
p <- ggbio() + circle(mut.gr, geom = "rect", color = "steelblue") +
    circle(hg19sub, geom = "ideo", fill = "gray70") +
    circle(hg19sub, geom = "scale", size = 2) +
  circle(hg19sub, geom = "text", aes(label = seqnames), vjust = 0, size = 3)
p
@


Next, we need to add some "links" to show the rearrangement, of course, links
can be used to map any kind of association between two or more different
locations to indicate relationships like copies or fusions. To create a suitable structure to plot, please use another \Rclass{GRanges} to
represent the end of the links, and stored as elementMetadata for the "start
point" \Rclass{GRanges}. Here we named it as "to.gr" and will be used later.
<<>>=
head(crc.gr)
@


Here in this example, we use "intrachromosomal" to label
rearrangement within the same chromosomes and use "interchromosomal" to label
rearrangement in different chromosomes.



Get subset of links data for only one sample "CRC1"

<<subset-crc-1>>=
gr.crc1 <- crc.gr[values(crc.gr)$individual == "CRC-1"]
@

Ok, add a "point" track with grid background for rearrangement data and map `y`
to variable "score", map `size` to variable "tumreads", rescale the size to a
proper size range.

<<lower-point-track>>=
## manually specify radius
p <- p + circle(gr.crc1, geom = "point", aes(y = score, size = tumreads),
                color = "red", grid = TRUE, radius = 30) + scale_size(range = c(1, 2.5))
p
@

% \clearpage
Finally, let's add links and map color to rearrangement types. Remember you need
to specify `linked.to` parameter to the column that contain end point of the data.
<<lower-link-track>>=
## specify radius manually
p <- p + circle(gr.crc1, geom = "link", linked.to = "to.gr", aes(color = rearrangements),
                       radius = 23)
p
@

All those code could be simply constructed by following code
<<>>=
p <- ggbio() +
   circle(gr.crc1, geom = "link", linked.to = "to.gr", aes(color = rearrangements)) +
  circle(gr.crc1, geom = "point", aes(y = score, size = tumreads),
                color = "red", grid = TRUE) + scale_size(range = c(1, 2.5)) +
  circle(mut.gr, geom = "rect", color = "steelblue") +
    circle(hg19sub, geom = "ideo", fill = "gray70") +
    circle(hg19sub, geom = "scale", size = 2) +
  circle(hg19sub, geom = "text", aes(label = seqnames), vjust = 0, size = 3)
p
@


\subsection{Complex arragnment of plots}
In this step, we are going to make multiple sample comparison, this may require
some knowledge about package \Rpackage{grid} and \Rpackage{gridExtra}. We will
introduce a more easy way to combine your graphics later after this.

We just want 9 single circular plots put together in one page, since we cannot
keep too many tracks, we only keep ideogram and links. Here is one sample.



<<arrangement>>=
grl <- split(crc.gr, values(crc.gr)$individual)
## need "unit", load grid
library(grid)
crc.lst <- lapply(grl, function(gr.cur){
  print(unique(as.character(values(gr.cur)$individual)))
  cols <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set2")[2:1]
  names(cols) <- c("interchromosomal", "intrachromosomal")
  p <- ggbio() + circle(gr.cur, geom = "link", linked.to = "to.gr",
                         aes(color = rearrangements)) +
                  circle(hg19sub, geom = "ideo",
                         color = "gray70", fill = "gray70") +
                  scale_color_manual(values = cols)  +
                  labs(title = (unique(values(gr.cur)$individual))) +
                  theme(plot.margin = unit(rep(0, 4), "lines"))
})
@

We wrap the function in grid level to a more user-friendly high level function,
called \Rfunction{arrangeGrobByParsingLegend}. You can pass your ggplot2
graphics to this function , specify the legend you want to keep on the right,
you can also specify the column/row numbers. Here we assume all plots we have
passed follows the same color scale and have the same legend, so we only have to
keep one legend on the right.


<<simple-wrapper, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5>>=

arrangeGrobByParsingLegend(crc.lst, widths = c(4, 1), legend.idx = 1, ncol = 3)
@

\section{How to make grandlinear plots}\label{section:grandlinear}
\subsection{Introduction}

Let's use a subset of \software{PLINK} output (\url{https://github.com/stephenturner/qqman/blob/master/plink.assoc.txt.gz}) as our example test data.

<<simul_snp>>=
snp <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "plink.assoc.sub.txt", package = "biovizBase"),
                  header = TRUE)
require(biovizBase)
gr.snp <- transformDfToGr(snp, seqnames = "CHR", start = "BP", width = 1)
head(gr.snp)
## change the seqname order
library(GenomeInfoDb)  # for keepSeqlevels()
gr.snp <- keepSeqlevels(gr.snp, as.character(1:22))
seqlengths(gr.snp)
## need to assign seqlengths
data(ideoCyto, package = "biovizBase")
seqlengths(gr.snp) <- as.numeric(seqlengths(ideoCyto$hg18)[1:22])
## remove missing
gr.snp <- gr.snp[!is.na(gr.snp$P)]
## transform pvalue
values(gr.snp)$pvalue <- -log10(values(gr.snp)$P)
head(gr.snp)
## done
@
The data is ready, we need to pay attention
\begin{itemize}
\item if seqlengths is missing, we use data range, so the chromosome length is not accurate
\item use seqlevel to control order of chromosome
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Corrdinate genome}
In \autoplot{}, argument \Rfunarg{coord} is just used to transform the data,
after that, you can use it as common \Robject{GRanges}, all other geom/stat
works for it.

<<line, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6>>=
autoplot(gr.snp, geom = "point", coord = "genome", aes(y = pvalue))
@

However, we recommend you to use more powerful function \Rfunction{plotGrandLinear} to generate manhattan plot introduced in next section.


\subsection{Convenient \Rfunction{plotGrandLinear} function}
For \textit{Manhattan plot}, we have a function called
\Rfunction{plotGrandLinear}. aes(y = ) is required to indicate the y
value, e.g.  p-value.

Color mapping is automatically figured out by \ggbio{} following the rules
\begin{itemize}
\item if \Rfunarg{color} present in \Rcode{aes()}, like \Rcode{aes(color =
    seqnames)}, it will assume it's mapping to data column called 'seqnames'.
\item if \Rfunarg{color} is not wrapped in \Rcode{aes()}, then this function
  will \textbf{recylcle} them to all chromosomes.
\item if \Rfunarg{color} is single character representing color, then just use
  one arbitrary color.
\end{itemize}

Let's test some examples for controling colors.

<<morecolor2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6>>=
plotGrandLinear(gr.snp, aes(y = pvalue), color = c("#7fc97f", "#fdc086"))
@

Let's add a cutoff line
<<fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6>>=
plotGrandLinear(gr.snp, aes(y = pvalue), color = c("#7fc97f", "#fdc086"),
                cutoff = 3, cutoff.color = "blue", cutoff.size = 0.2)

@

Sometimes you use color to mapping other varibles so you may need a different to separate chromosomes.

<<fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6>>=

plotGrandLinear(gr.snp, aes(y = pvalue, color = OR), spaceline = TRUE, legend = TRUE)
@


\subsection{How to highlight some points?}
You can provide a highlight \gr{}, and each row highlights a set of overlaped
snps, and labeled by rownames or certain columns, there is more control in the
function as parameters, with prefix highlight.*, so you could control color,
label size and color, etc.

<<fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6>>=
gro <- GRanges(c("1", "11"), IRanges(c(100, 2e6), width = 5e7))
names(gro) <- c("group1", "group2")
plotGrandLinear(gr.snp, aes(y = pvalue), highlight.gr = gro)

\section{How to make stacked karyogram overview plots}\label{section:stacked}
\subsection{Introduction}
A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a
eukaryotic cell\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype}. It's one kind
of overview when we want to show distribution of certain events on the genome,
for example, binding sites for certain protein, even compare them across samples
as example shows in this section.

\Robject{GRanges} and \Robject{Seqinfo} objects are an ideal container for
storing data needed for karyogram plot. Here is the strategy we used for
generating ideogram templates.
\begin{itemize}
\item Althouth \Robject{seqlengths} is not required, it's highly recommended for
  plotting karyogram. If a \Robject{GRanges} object contains
  \Robject{seqlengths}, we know exactly how long each chromosome is, and will
  use this information to plot genome space, particularly we plot all levels
  included in it, \textbf{NOT JUST} data space.
\item If a \Robject{GRanges} has no \Robject{seqlengths}, we will issue a
  warning and try to estimate the chromosome lengths from data included. This is
  \textbf{NOT} accurate most time, so please pay attention to what you are going
  to visualize and make sure set \Robject{seqlengths} before hand.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Create karyogram temlate}
Let's first introduce how to use \autoplot{} to generate karyogram graphic.

The most easy one is to just plot Seqinfo by using \autoplot{}, if your \gr{}
object has seqinfo with seqlengths information. Then you add data layer later.

<<>>=
data(ideoCyto, package = "biovizBase")
autoplot(seqinfo(ideoCyto$hg19), layout = "karyogram")
@

To show cytobands, your data need to have cytoband information, we stored some data for you, including \textit{hg19, hg18, mm10, mm9}.

<<fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4>>=
## turn on cytobands if present
biovizBase::isIdeogram(ideoCyto$hg19)
autoplot(ideoCyto$hg19, layout = "karyogram", cytobands = TRUE)
@

To change order or only show a subset of the karyogram, you have to manipulate \Rfunction{seqlevels}, please check out manual for \Rfunction{keepSeqlevels, seqlevels} in \Biocpkg{GenomeInfoDb} package for more information. Or you could read the example below.

\subsection{Add data on karyogram layout}
If you have single data set stored as \Rclass{GRanges} to show on a karyogram layout, \autoplot{} function is enough for you to plot the data on it.

We use a default data in package \Rpackage{biovizBase}, which is a subset of RNA
editing set in human. The data involved in this \Robject{GRanges} is sparse, so
we cannot simply use it to make karyogram template, otherwise, the estimated chromosome
lengths will be very rough and inaccurate. So what we need to do first is to \emph{add seglength information to this object.}


<<load-RNAediting>>=
data(darned_hg19_subset500, package = "biovizBase")
dn <- darned_hg19_subset500
library(GenomicRanges)
seqlengths(dn)
## add seqlengths
## we have seqlegnths information in another data set
seqlengths(dn) <- seqlengths(ideoCyto$hg19)[names(seqlengths(dn))]
## then we change order
library(GenomeInfoDb)  # for keepSeqlevels()
dn <- keepSeqlevels(dn, paste0("chr", c(1:22, "X")))
seqlengths(dn)
autoplot(dn, layout = "karyogram")
@


Then we take one step further, the power of \ggplot{} or \ggbio{} is the
flexible multivariate data mapping ability in graphics, make data exploration
much more convenient. In the following example, we are trying to map a
categorical variable 'exReg' to color, this variable is included in the data,
and have three levels, '3' indicate 3' utr, '5' means 5' utr and 'C' means
coding region. We have some missing values indicated as \Rcode{NA}, in default,
it's going to be shown in gray color, and keep in mind, since the basic
geom(geometric object) is rectangle, and genome space is very large, so change
both color/fill color of the rectangle to specify both border and filled color
is necessary to get the data shown as different color, otherwise if the region
is too small, border color is going to override the fill color.

<<load-RNAediting-color>>=
## since default is geom rectangle, even though it's looks like segment
## we still use both fill/color to map colors
autoplot(dn, layout = "karyogram", aes(color = exReg, fill = exReg))
@

Or you can set the missing value to particular color yo
u want (NA values is not shown on the legend).

<<>>=
## since default is geom rectangle, even though it's looks like segment
## we still use both fill/color to map colors
autoplot(dn, layout = "karyogram", aes(color = exReg, fill = exReg), alpha  = 0.5) +
  scale_color_discrete(na.value = "brown")
@

Well, sometimes we have too many values, we want to separate them by groups and show them at diffent height, below is a hack for that purpose and in next section, we will introduce a more flexible and general way to add data layer by layer.

\emph{Template chromosome y limits is [0, 10], that's why this hack works}

<<fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4>>=
## let's remove the NA value
dn.nona <- dn[!is.na(dn$exReg)]
## compute levels based on categories
dn.nona$levels <- as.numeric(factor(dn.nona$exReg))
## do a trcik show them at different height
p.ylim <- autoplot(dn.nona, layout = "karyogram", aes(color = exReg, fill = exReg,
                                       ymin = (levels - 1) * 10/3,
                                       ymax = levels * 10 /3))
@

\subsection{Add more data using layout\_karyogram function}
In this section, a lower level function \Rfunction{layout\_karyogram} is going
to be introduced. This is convenient API for constructing karyogram plot and
adding more data layer by layer. Function \Rfunction{ggplot} is just to create
blank object to add layer on.

You need to pay attention to
\begin{itemize}
\item when you add plots layer by layer, seqnames of different data must be the
  same to make sure the data are mapped to the same chromosome. For example, if
  you name chromosome following schema like \textit{chr1} and use just number
  \textit{1} to name other data, they will be treated as different chromosomes.
\item cannot use the same aesthetics mapping multiple time for different
  data. For example, if you have used aes(color = ), for one data, you cannot
  use aes(color = ) anymore for mapping variables from other add-on data, this
  is currently not allowed in \ggplot{}, even though you expect multiple color
  legend shows up, this is going to confuse people which is which. HOWEVER,
  \Rfunarg{color} or \Rfunarg{fill} without \Rcode{aes()} wrap around, is
  allowed for any track, it's set single arbitrary color.
\item Default rectangle y range is [0, 10], so when you add on more data layer
  by layer on existing graphics, you can use \Rfunarg{ylim} to control how to
  normalize your data and plot it relative to chromosome space. For example,
  with default, chromosome space is plotted between y [0, 10], if you use
  \Rcode{ylim = c(10 , 20)}, you will stack data right above each chromosomes
  and with equal width. For geom like 'point', which you need to specify 'y'
  value in \Rcode{aes()}, we will add 5\% margin on top and at bottom of that
  track.
\end{itemize}

Many times we overlay different datas sets, so let's break down the previous samples into 4 groups and treat them as different data and build them layer by layer, assign the color by hand. You could use ylim to control where they are ploted.
<<>>=
## prepare the data
dn3 <- dn.nona[dn.nona$exReg == '3']
dn5 <- dn.nona[dn.nona$exReg == '5']
dnC <- dn.nona[dn.nona$exReg == 'C']
dn.na <- dn[is.na(dn$exReg)]
## now we have 4 different data sets
autoplot(seqinfo(dn3), layout = "karyogram") +
  layout_karyogram(data = dn3, geom = "rect", ylim = c(0, 10/3), color = "#7fc97f") +
  layout_karyogram(data = dn5, geom = "rect", ylim = c(10/3, 10/3*2), color = "#beaed4") +
  layout_karyogram(data = dnC, geom = "rect", ylim = c(10/3*2, 10), color = "#fdc086") +
  layout_karyogram(data = dn.na, geom = "rect", ylim = c(10, 10/3*4), color = "brown")
@

What's more, you could even chagne the geom for those data
<<edit-space, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4>>=
dn$pvalue <- runif(length(dn)) * 10
p <- autoplot(seqinfo(dn)) + layout_karyogram(dn, aes(x = start, y = pvalue),
                     geom = "point", color = "#fdc086")
p
@

p.ylim + facet_wrap(~seqnames)

\chapter{Miscellaneous}\label{chapter:misc}
Every plot object produced by \ggplot{} is essentially a \ggplot{}
object, so you could use all the tricks you know with \ggplot{} on
\ggbio{} plots too, including scales, colors, themes, etc.

\section{Themes}
In \ggbio{}, we developed some more themes to make things easier.

\subsection{Plot theme}
Plot level themes are like any other themes defined in \ggplot{},
simply apply it to a plot.

<<>>=
p.txdb
p.txdb + theme_alignment()
p.txdb + theme_clear()
p.txdb + theme_null()
@ %def

When you have multiple chromosomes encoded in seqnames, you could use
theme\_genome to make a 'fake' linear view of genome coordinates
quickly by applying this theme, because it's not equal to chromosome
lengths, it's simply

<<>>=
library(GenomicRanges)
set.seed(1)
N <- 100
gr <- GRanges(seqnames = sample(c("chr1", "chr2", "chr3"),
                     size = N, replace = TRUE),
              IRanges(start = sample(1:300, size = N, replace = TRUE),
                      width = sample(70:75, size = N,replace = TRUE)),
              strand = sample(c("+", "-"), size = N, replace = TRUE),
              value = rnorm(N, 10, 3), score = rnorm(N, 100, 30),
              sample = sample(c("Normal", "Tumor"),
                size = N, replace = TRUE),
              pair = sample(letters, size = N,
                replace = TRUE))
seqlengths(gr) <- c(400, 1000, 500)
autoplot(gr)
autoplot(gr) + theme_genome()
@ %def


\subsection{Track theme}
Track level themes are more complex, it controls whole looking of the
tracks, it's essentially a theme object with some attributes
controlling the tracks appearance.

See how we make a template, you could customize in the same way
<<>>=
theme_tracks_sunset
@

The attributes you could control is basically passed to tracks()
constructor, including

\begin{table}[h!t!b!p]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
   \hline
   label.bg.color & character \\\hline
   label.bg.fill & character\\\hline

   label.text.cex & numeric\\\hline
   label.text.angle & numeric\\\hline
   track.plot.color & character\_OR\_NULL\\\hline
   track.bg.color & character\_OR\_NULL\\\hline
